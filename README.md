Reflection on Project Management Tools:
Using GitHub’s project management tools, such as milestones, issues, and project boards, significantly enhances team collaboration and organization. Milestones provide clear deadlines and goals, helping the team focus on completing essential tasks in time. Issues serve as a central point to report and track bugs, features, and tasks, ensuring that no item goes unaddressed. By assigning issues to specific team members and adding labels, it becomes easier to prioritize work and maintain accountability. Project boards give a clear visual overview of the project's status, making it simple to track progress and identify potential bottlenecks.

However, implementing these tools may pose challenges. One challenge could be ensuring that all team members consistently update the status of their tasks on the project board. It may also be difficult to estimate accurate due dates for milestones if the team isn't familiar with the complexities of certain tasks. Another challenge is prioritization—sometimes, urgent bugs or changes can disrupt planned workflows, making it hard to stick to milestones or move tasks along the project board as expected. Nonetheless, with regular communication and adherence to these tools, the team can improve efficiency and project transparency.
